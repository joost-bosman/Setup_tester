# Security Policy

## Supported versions
Only the latest release gets security updates. Older builds are "as is."

## Reporting a vulnerability
This project is built with the best intentions and motivations, and releases are done to the best of my abilities.
Maintenance will not happen often; this is 100% a hobby, and time is limited.
I am not accepting security reports for this project; there is no monitored security inbox, and I do not guarantee responses.
If you choose to report something anyway, it is strictly best-effort and may not get a reply.

## Testing and responsibility
- Every tweak, addition, build, and release is meant to get a vulnerability check.
- Results are logged in `docs/VULNERABILITY_TEST_RESULTS.md` and skip personal or setup-specific details.
- This tool is helpful, but it does not replace your own responsibility or judgment.
