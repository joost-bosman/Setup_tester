# Code of Conduct

This project follows the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct.

## Our pledge
This tool is built out of a development interest as a new hobby, a way to make things easier for myself. Along the way I thought it could help others too, so that is why I am sharing it. Hope it helps you too!
We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards
Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Learning is fun
- Stronger together
- More fun together
- All against one is for the weak
- Everyone is a champion at her/his level, in different contexts and settings

## Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Attempting to hack or spam others
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement
There is no monitored inbox for Code of Conduct reports.
Reports are not accepted, and any messages received are handled on a best-effort basis with no response guaranteed.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1.
